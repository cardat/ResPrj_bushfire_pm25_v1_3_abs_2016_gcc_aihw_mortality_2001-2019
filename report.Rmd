## Study area
```{r, echo=FALSE}

a <- "figures_and_tables/fig_study_area.png"

# Include the plot in the report
knitr::include_graphics(a)
```

## Outcome
### Average Daily Mortality 2001-2020 (AIHW all causes and ages)

```{r, echo=FALSE}
aihw <- "figures_and_tables/fig_mortality.png"
knitr::include_graphics(aihw)

```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
mort <- targets::tar_read(tab_mortality)
# Create the table with kable
knitr::kable(
  mort, 
  caption = 
    "Summary of study cities and number of deaths from 2001 to 2020"
  )
```

## Exposure
```{r, echo=FALSE}
exposure <- targets::tar_read(tab_exposure)
# Create the table with kable
knitr::kable(
  exposure, 
  caption = 
    "Summary  in number of days per air quality level. The ratio represents the sum of all days with PM₂.₅ (µg/m³) levels not considered good by WHO divided by days considered good. GCCs are ranked from best to worst ratio."
  )
```

### PM₂.₅ (µg/m³) time-series 2001-2020
```{r, echo=FALSE}

p <- "figures_and_tables/fig_exposure_time_series.png"

# Include the plot in the report
knitr::include_graphics(p)
```

## Methods
PM₂.₅ Predicted = Daily PM2.5 predictions from the random forest model (Bushfire_specific_PM25_Aus_2001_2020_v1_3).

The STL method is used to decompose the time-series into three components: trend, seasonal, and remainder.

The counterfactual is calculated as the sum of the seasonal and trend components, i.e., Counterfactual = Seasonal + Trend.

Following the HRAPIE project's recommendations for concentration–response functions for cost–benefit analysis of particulate matter, the estimated Relative Risk (RR) per 10 μg/m³ increase in PM₂.₅ is 1.0123, with a 95% Confidence Interval (CI) of 1.0045 to 1.0201:

$$
RR_{10\, \mu g/m^3} = 1.0123 \, (95\% \, CI: 1.0045 - 1.0201)
$$
Then, we calculate beta:

$$
\beta = \frac{\log(RR_{10\, \mu g/m^3})}{10}
$$

Subsequently, we define the delta as the difference between the PM₂.₅ predicted value and the counterfactual:

$$
\Delta = (PM₂.₅_{\text{predicted}}) - (\text{Counterfactual})
$$

Finally, we calculate the relative risk as the exponential of the product of beta and the mean of the yearly delta:

$$
\text{Relative Risk} = \exp \left( \beta \times \Delta_{\text{daily}} \right)
$$

```{r echo=FALSE}
an_sum <- targets::tar_read(calc_an_all_ages_sum)
knitr::kable(an_sum, 
             caption = "Attributable Number - Sum" )
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(an)
```

## Sensitivity analysis
### 95th percentile

```{r, echo=FALSE}
an_sens <- targets::tar_read(calc_an_all_ages_sens_sum)
knitr::kable(an_sens, 
             caption = "Attributable Number (95th percentile)" )
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}

an <- "figures_and_tables/fig_an_100_sens.png"
knitr::include_graphics(an)
